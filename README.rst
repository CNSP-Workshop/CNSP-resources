CNSP resources 
===============================================

Welcome to the resource page of the Cognition and Natural Sensory Processing (CNSP) open-science initiative!
The resources include guidelines, data, scripts, and GUIs for sharing and analysing neural data involving continuous stimuli (e.g., speech or music listening). Specifically, we offer:

    📜 Data standardisation and sharing guidelines (CND data structure)
    📚 A list of publicly available datasets (primarily EEG) shared in CND
    ⚙️ Original analysis scripts for rapidly analysing those CND datasets
    ⚙️ A data simulation toolkit
    ⚙️ A GUI for carrying out typical analyses

Note that each dataset should be used according to its own license and should be referenced as indicated by the authors in their original submission.

The main files to download, which can be taken as blueprint for new analyses, are: CNSP Resources Skeleton, which contains the folder structure and a basic tutorial code; CNSP Libraries, which should be unzipped in the 'libs' folder; the CND version of Natural speech listening and Bach piano melodies, which can also be found in the table below; and the CNSP2022 tutorials of interest listed below, which can be run on any CND dataset with minimal code modification.
