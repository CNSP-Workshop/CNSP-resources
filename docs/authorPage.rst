How-to Guides 
=============

This page contains a number of practical guides for setting up and using the CNSP resources.

Getting started
---------------

This guide details the requirements and key steps for setting up the the CNSP resources on your computer.
The core component of the libraries and tutorials requires MATLAB software. We also include Python tutorials
and aim to add more in the future. Part of the resources are independent on a specific programming language (e.g., GUI).

Getting started (MATLAB CNSP-core)
----------------------------------
This section provides guidelines for setting up the CNSP core resources using MATLAB software.

Below we assume you have the MATLAB environment already configured on your computer (>2019).
The first step is to set up the CNSP project folder structure (skeleton) with the up-to-date libraries.
We can't stress enough the importance of utilising the skeleton as instructed. For example, 
we strongly encourage to include all libraries in the CNSP project folder and to utilise the precise
naming protocol described in our guidelines and in `Di Liberto et al., 2023 (in preparation) <https://cnspworkshop.net>`_.

Download starter-kit `here <https://github.com/CNSP-Workshop/CNSP-resources/tree/main/CNSP>`_.
The starter-kit contains the folder skeleton, basic how-to scripts, tutorials, and up-to-date libraries. Please note that the
libraries contain slim versions of dependencies such as EEGLAB (used for the spline interpolation and topopolot functions),
the mTRF-Toolbox (used for the TRF method), and NoiseTools (used for the CCA method). Each folder contains the specific licence
and references for the corresponding library.
