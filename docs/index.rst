Getting started 
===============
For beginners, we suggest going through the tutorials in the order indicated in this documentation.
For new users with at least a basic understanding of analysis methods such as the TRF, we suggest starting from the first `How-to guide <howtoPage.html>`_  

Note that each dataset should be used according to its own license and should be referenced as indicated by the authors in their original submission.
