Welcome to the resource page of the Cognition and Natural Sensory Processing (CNSP) open-science initiative!
The resources include guidelines, data, scripts, and GUIs for sharing and analysing neural data involving continuous stimuli (e.g., speech or music listening). Specifically, we offer:

Getting started 
===============
For beginners, we suggest going through the tutorials in the order indicated in this documentation.
For new users with at least a basic understanding of analysis methods such as the TRF, we suggest starting from the first How-to guide 'Getting started' <gettingStartedPage>  

Note that each dataset should be used according to its own license and should be referenced as indicated by the authors in their original submission.


Getting started <startingPage>
The main files to download, which can be taken as blueprint for new analyses, are: CNSP Resources Skeleton, which contains the folder structure and a basic tutorial code; CNSP Libraries, which should be unzipped in the 'libs' folder; the CND version of Natural speech listening and Bach piano melodies, which can also be found in the table below; and the CNSP2022 tutorials of interest listed below, which can be run on any CND dataset with minimal code modification.
