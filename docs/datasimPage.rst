CNSP Data simulation toolkit
############################


With neural signal analysis the ground-truth signal is not available, and is often obscured by large 
amounts of noise. However, for the development of methodologies for neural signal analysis, and for the
generation of numerical expectations on a hypothesis, it is necessary to know the ground-truth signal. 
Simulation data can be used for these problems. 

The simulation toolkit is a graphical interface for easily running simulations. The three steps needed 
shown in the figure below: (1) Design TRF, (2) Select TRF, (3)Simulate neural signal.
