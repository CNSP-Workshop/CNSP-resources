Please find here example scripts re-worked for the CNSP2025 workshop. These scripts are meant to be blueprints for mTRF analyses, providing a starting point for your analysis. Please make sure to use the exact folder structure and libraries indicated in our documentation and papers (https://nbdt.scholasticahq.com/article/124867-a-standardised-open-science-framework-for-sharing-and-re-analysing-neural-data-acquired-to-continuous-stimuli). If you do that correctly, this script will run without any changes.
