CNSP-Workshop 2021

This folder includes neural recordings conducted during natural speech and music listening. The datasets were shared by the respective authors previously through various repositories and by using different lab-specific data-sharing formats. We have converted the data into the CND format (see data preparation guidelines). In this particular version, we are sharing the CND data and the conversion script used to transform the original shared data into CND. Please see each readme file to see where the original shared data can be downloaded (not necessary for the workshop).

Please note that these datasets were part of previously published work and have been shared on various repositories. If you use any of these datasets, you should cite:
- The original published work (see the readme file of each dataset).
- The original dataset, shared in an online repository providing a DOI (e.g., dryad) if available (see the readme file of each dataset).
- The CNSP-Workshop, if you use the CND format or any of the material shared or written during this workshop.
