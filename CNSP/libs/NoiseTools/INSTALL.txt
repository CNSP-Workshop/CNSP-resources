Put this directory (../NoiseTools/) in your matlab path.  You may need also to add ../compat.

Functions in the main directory are prefixed 'nt_' to reduce likelihood of name conflicts
with other tooboxes. Functions in compat/ lack the 'nt_' prefix and may conflict.  If so
remove compat/ from the path or remove the offending function.
